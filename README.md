Testing a recommender system


Based on an Amazon dataset (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/), 
I've tried building a very simplistic recommender system using Pearson Correlation.

There are numerous flaws in it which I won't go through right now, but it has helped achieve the following:
- Understand how to use scipy sparse matrices
- Understand how a basic user-item collaborative filtering system works
- Create a (relatively) scalable solution for this problem
